Eat-Da-Burger: Burger eating simulator (?)

* This app is a simple demonstration of using a mySql database with an express server hosted on heroku

* The app functions by having a user input names of burgers, which are added as instances in a burger table in the database

* Each burger has a "devoured" status, which determines where they are displayed on the screen. If the burger is undevoured, the burger sits on the left side of the screen with an option to devour it. When it is devoured, it moves to the right side of the screen
